# Investigation Summary: Error Handling and Command Flow in TaskController

## Identified Problem
The `TaskController` does not explicitly handle the case when `PostCommand` returns `-1`, which indicates the command is not a cancel operation. Additionally, when a supra profile is not found, a generic exception is thrown. This leads to ambiguous responses and inconsistent error handling.

## Impact
- Clients may receive unclear or misleading HTTP responses.
- Error handling is not consistent, making debugging and maintenance more difficult.

## Best Options Identified

### 1. Use `ActionResult<T>` and Return Appropriate HTTP Status Codes
- Return suitable HTTP codes such as 400, 404, 409, or 500 depending on the error type.
- Allows clients to correctly interpret the result of the operation.

### 2. Create Custom Exceptions and Handle Them Explicitly in Controllers
- Enables precise HTTP status codes and makes error handling easily extensible.
- Improves traceability and control over different error types.

### 3. Implement Global Error Handling Middleware
- Centralizes error management and reduces code duplication in controllers.
- Allows for standardized error responses and formatting.

### 4. Standardize Error Responses with a JSON Structure
- Define a consistent format for errors (e.g., message, detail).
- Makes it easier for clients to consume and interpret errors.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to combine the above options for robust, consistent, and maintainable error handling. In particular:
- Implement global middleware to capture and manage errors.
- Use custom exceptions for relevant business cases.
- Standardize error responses in JSON format.
- Always return appropriate HTTP status codes based on the operation result.
- Explicitly handle the `-1` return value from `PostCommand` to ensure correct flow for non-cancel commands.
- Choose a consistent error handling strategy:
    - Use custom exceptions and middleware for centralized error handling and standardized response formatting.
    - Return HTTP status codes directly for simplicity in straightforward cases.
