# Investigation Summary: Error Handling in TaskController

## Identified Problem
The TaskController returns HTTP 200 even when errors occur (e.g., constraint violations in SQLite or file access errors with OpenCV).

## Impact
Client applications cannot reliably distinguish between successful and failed calls, as the HTTP status code does not reflect the actual outcome of the operation.

## Best Options Identified

### 1. Use `ActionResult<T>` and Return Appropriate HTTP Status Codes
- Return suitable HTTP codes such as 400, 404, 409, or 500 depending on the error type.
- Allows clients to correctly interpret the result of the operation.

### 2. Create Custom Exceptions and Handle Them Explicitly in Controllers
- Enables precise HTTP status codes and makes error handling easily extensible.
- Improves traceability and control over different error types.

### 3. Implement Global Error Handling Middleware
- Centralizes error management and reduces code duplication in controllers.
- Allows for standardized error responses and formatting.

### 4. Standardize Error Responses with a JSON Structure
- Define a consistent format for errors (e.g., message, detail).
- Makes it easier for clients to consume and interpret errors.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to combine the above options to achieve robust, consistent, and maintainable error handling. Specifically:
- Implement global middleware to capture and manage errors.
- Use custom exceptions for relevant business cases.
- Standardize error responses in JSON format.
- Always return appropriate HTTP status codes based on the operation result.
